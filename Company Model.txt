Company Database

A database is being designed for a company that will track employees, departments, and projects. Use the following data to develop the database. Develop an entity relationship diagram identifying all entities, attributes, and relationships. List any assumptions.

Database requirements:
1 Each of the employees has a first, middle, and last name, address, salary, date of birth, social security number, supervisor, and the department they work for.
2 Each of the departments has a name, number, employees, a department manager, and one or more locations.
3 The company also wants to track when managers started managing a department and how many employees are currently working for each department.
4 Each of the companyâ€™s projects are identified by their name and number and are tied to a Department. 
5 The database will need to track which department is in control of a project, which employees are working on a project, and for how many hours they worked on the project. 
6 For tax and insurance purposes the company is required to track the name, date of birth and relationship type of any of its employees' dependents.
